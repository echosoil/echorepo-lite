    <h4>Short description of the research project:</h4>
    <p>
      ECHO is a Research and Innovation Action co-funded by the European Union (GA NO. 101112869) and the UK
      Research and Innovation (UKRI) (GA no. 10068004) that aims to engage citizens in protecting and restoring soils
      by building their skills and enhancing their knowledge on soils.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a citizen scientist creates an account in the ECHOSoil App, we collect only the minimum mandatory
      information needed to operate the service, which is the e-mail. This e-mail is stored securely and is used only for
      account-related purposes (for example, password recovery). It is not published anywhere by the project and is
      not shown to other project participants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each account also receives a unique, non-identifiable internal ID. This ID - and not the e-mail – is what we use to
      link the surveys completed by the same user.
